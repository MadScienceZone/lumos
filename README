Lumos 0.0 (EXP) "README"

This is Lumos, a lightweight system for orchestrating light displays.
It is designed to be simple and flexible, and not tied to any proprietary
operating system or development platform.  It should run equally well on
a Macintosh, Windows, or Linux/Unix system.  

This is an EXPERIMENTAL DEVELOPMENT RELEASE (pre-alpha).  It is still
very much a work in progress, and not yet ready for widespread use.  If
you would like to get an early preview of the software and/or assist with
testing and providing feedback to the developer, feel free to do so, but
don't expect a solid, finished product yet.  See the RELEASE_NOTES file
for more information.

The files contained in this distribution are arranged as follows:
  bin/            -- user programs (this directory should be in your PATH)
