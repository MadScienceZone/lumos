.TH LUMOSUPGRADE 1 2.0 "Lumos SSR Controller" "Utility Commands"
.SH NAME
lumosupgrade \- Download new firmware image into Lumos controller hardware
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lumosupgrade
.RB [ \-hv ]
.B \-a
.I addr
.RB [ \-b
.IR speed ]
.I image-file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This command places the target Lumos controller device into
\*(lqprogram mode\*(rq and downloads a new firmware image
onto it.  This is used in order to upgrade the Lumos firmware
to a new version.
.LP
The board must first be connected to the host PC (all by itself,
not sharing a serial connection with other devices), and that connection
must be bidirectional as the Lumos board needs to be able to acknowledge
receipt of the new image.
.LP
The Lumos board is then placed into configuration mode (sometimes called
\*(lqprivileged mode\*(rq).  Then the
.B lumosupgrade
program is invoked to load a new firmware image onto it.
.LP
Once started, this process must run to successful completion
before the Lumos board may be used for normal operations again.
If anything goes amiss, the Lumos board may be reset and the 
.B lumosupgrade
program re-started.  (Upon reset, the Lumos board will stay in
program mode until a new image has been loaded into it.  Should the
board reset/reboot for any reason during the process, the 
.B lumosupgrade
process must be started over to ensure a complete image is loaded.)
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
Each of the following options may be specified by either a long
option (like
.RB \*(lq \-\-verbose \*(rq)
or a shorter option letter (like
.RB \*(lq \-v \*(rq).
If an option takes a parameter, it may follow the option as
.RB \*(lq \-a12 \*(rq,
.RB \*(lq "\-a 12" \*(rq,
.RB \*(lq "\-\-address 12" \*(rq,
or
.RB \*(lq "\-\-address=12" \*(rq.
.LP
Long option names may be abbreviated to any unambiguous initial substring.
.TP 17 \" <<list>>
.BI \-\-address= addr
.RB ( \-a
.IR addr )
Specifies the address of the target controller unit.  The
.I addr
value is an integer from 0 to 15, inclusive.  
Note that downloading a new firmware image must be done when the
target unit is the
.I only
device plugged in to the computer.  Once the download operation is
underway, the low-level protocol used to transmit the image to the
device is not necessarily compatible with other units.  This option
is required because the command to place the device into programming
mode must be addressed to the unit.
.TP
.B \-\-help
.RB ( \-h )
Prints a summary of these options and exits.
.TP
.BI \-\-speed= rate
.RB ( \-b
.IR rate )
Set the serial port to the given
baud
.IR rate .
This is the speed the device is already configured to use, and will be used for the initial
command to enter programming mode.  Once in programming mode, however, a fixed speed of 9600
baud will be used.
[Default is 19200 baud.]
.TP
.B \-\-verbose
.RB ( \-v )
Output messages to the standard output.  Additional 
.B \-\-verbose
options increases verbosity.  High levels of verbosity include a dump
of every bit sent or received on the serial network.
