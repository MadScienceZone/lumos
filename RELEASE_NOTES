CURRENT RELEASE:
  Lumos 0.4a1 [30 November 2011]
    **ALPHA TEST RELEASE**

	Additions:
	  * Introduced sequence file format V3 which is idential to V2 except
	    it adds support for audio tracks in the sequence.
	  * Vixen2lumos will recognize an audio file attached to the Vixen
	    sequence and include it in the V3 Lumos sequence file it writes.
 	  * Lumos code will read either V2 or V3 files, but always writes V3.
	  * Lplay will now play the audio track attacked to the sequence files
	    when running the sequence.
	  * The "48ssr" controller has been renamed "lumos".  The older name
	    is deprecated but still recognized (for now).
	  * Added a new bin utility, "ssrctl" which allows manual setting
	    of channel outputs, interactively or in batch (from the command 
	    line)
	  * Changed the Windows distribution to have a .py extension on the
	    executable scripts, so Windows will be able to execute them directly.
		The user would still need to have the Python script directory in their
		PATH, however.
		

	New Dependencies:
	  * Now requires the pygame module.

  KNOWN ISSUES:
  	* Most of the device drivers are still untested. 
	* Only "serial" networks have been tested yet.
	   -- serialbit, parallel and parbit networks have not yet been finished.

PREVIOUS VERSIONS:
  Lumos 0.3a3 [23 January 2009]
    **ALPHA TEST RELEASE**

	Additions:
	  * Change to implementation of Lumos.Show class which makes it
	    easier for new classes to extend Lumos.Show.

  KNOWN ISSUES:
  	* Most of the device drivers are still untested. 
	* Only "serial" networks have been tested yet.
	   -- serialbit, parallel and parbit networks have not yet been finished.


  Lumos 0.3a2 [04 January 2009]
    **ALPHA TEST RELEASE**
    Bug fixes: 
	  * lcheck wasn't iterating over channels correctly for some kinds
	    of controllers.
	
	Additions:
	  * Created first draft of Lumos User's Guide document.

  KNOWN ISSUES:
  	* Most of the device drivers are still untested. 
	* Only "serial" networks have been tested yet.
	   -- serialbit, parallel and parbit networks have not yet been finished.

  Lumos 0.3a1 [30 December 2008]
    **ALPHA TEST RELEASE**
    This product is still in ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT and is released for 
	evaluation and testing purposes, not for actual production use.

    Newer design features over previous versions.  
	Final product name "Lumos" chosen and SourceForge project created.
    Added separate device drivers and the ability to easily add more kinds 
	of controllers (Lumos 0.1~0.2 was designed to drive the author's own 
	"48SSR" controller circuits.)
	Added separate network drivers, including bit- and byte-at-once 
	concepts for serial and parallel interfaces.
	Added Lumos sequence import utility.
	Much refactoring of old code, bugs fixed, more unit tests and docs.

  KNOWN ISSUES:
  	* Most of the device drivers are still untested. 
	* Only "serial" networks have been tested yet.
	   -- serialbit, parallel and parbit networks have not yet been finished.

  Lumos 0.2 [2006]
    Previously known by internal working title "Aurora 1.1"; never released
	for public use.  Incremental improvements over the 0.1 product before
	the newer architecture introduced for 0.3.

  Lumos 0.1 [2005]
    Previously known by internal working title "Aurora 1.0"; never released
	for public use.  Included some basic sequence playback functionality,
	using a CSV file format with the intent of using a spreadsheet as a scene
	editor.  (Note that the Lumos 1.0 CSV "V2" sequence file format is 
	completely redesigned and incompatible with this older "V1" format.)

FUTURE VERSIONS:
  Lumos 1.0 [expected 2009]
    This will be the first product release when enough basic functionality
	has been implemented to call it a fully usable product.

About Version Numbers and Release Notations:
  Lumos version numbers consist of two or three numbers separated by 
  dots (".").  These are not decimal points--the next release after 1.9 
  would be 1.10.  The first number is the MAJOR RELEASE NUMBER.  This 
  number is zero (0) during initial development, and will change to one
  (1) for the first actual product release.  Thereafter, it will increment
  every time a major change is made to the Lumos program functionality, 
  structure, architecture, etc.  The second number is the MINOR RELEASE
  NUMBER.  This is set to zero (0) every time the major release number
  changes, and increments thereafter when minor changes are made to program
  functionality.  An optional third number is the PATCH RELEASE NUMBER,
  and is incremented when a defect-fix change is made with no added features.
  Thus, you can generally assume that a release called 1.5.2 will look and
  act the same as 1.5 and 1.5.1 did, except that it should be a more correct
  implementation (i.e., corrected for defects discovered in the previous 
  versions), while 1.6 would have at least some minor change to its feature
  set. 

  In addition, version numberss are followed by a notation indicating what
  level of stability and verification it has attained:
    a1, a2, ...   -- ALPHA release #1, #2, etc.  This is a release of code
	                 under active development, and not considered stable at 
					 all.  Anything at all may change at any time during
					 the alpha stage.
	b1, b2, ...   -- BETA test release #1, #2, etc.  The product is nearing
	                 release condition, and should only change to fix bugs.
					 It has not yet been considered to be stable, nor
					 intended for use other than for testing purposes.
	pr1, pr2, ... -- PRE-RELEASE release #1, #2, etc.  Final testing to 
	                 discover any issues before officially releasing the
					 product for general use.
					 
  These are in chronological order (so a product version 1.5.2 would progress
  from 1.5.2a1 to 1.5.2a2, 1.5.2a3, ..., 1.5.2b1, ..., 1.5.2pr1, ..., and 
  finally 1.5.2), and changes (generally only defect corrections) may be 
  introduced as the code moves down this list.  Generally speaking, the code 
  should not be put into real production use until it gets to the "RELEASE" 
  stage.

  Notwithstanding our best good-faith effort to ensure the quality of this
  software, and the use of terms like "EXPERIMENTAL", "RELEASE", etc., this
  software and all accompanying materials are provided "AS-IS" with no 
  warranty of any kind whatsoever to the extent allowed by applicable law
  (see LICENSE file for full details).
