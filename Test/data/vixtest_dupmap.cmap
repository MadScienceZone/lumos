# Lumos Channel Map
#
# This maps Vixen sequence file channels to Lumos sequence file channels.  
# This is in standard CSV format.  Fields containing commas need to be
# surrounded by double quotes (although any field may be).  If the first
# field on a line begins with a pound sign (#), then that line is ignored
# as a comment.
#
# The fields are:
#    INDEX,NAME,CONTROLLER,CHANNEL
#
# INDEX       is an integer value specifying the channel index number,
#             where the first channel appearing in the Vixen file is
#             number 0, the next is number 1, etc.
#
# NAME        is the name associated with the channel in Vixen, which
#             is displayed on the grid for that channel.
#
# CONTROLLER  is the name defined in the show configuration file for
#             the Lumos controller which will be assigned to this
#             channel.
#
# CHANNEL     is the name of the channel controlled by CONTROLLER.
#
# You may specify either INDEX or NAME (or both), but note that if 
# you leave one out the field is left empty:
#     12,,
#
# The first field is either 'index' or 'name', and specifies whether
# you are mapping Vixen channels by index number (i.e., numbered 
# sequentially from zero in the order they appear in the Vixen file, 
# which is the number shown in the output of 'vixen2lumos --info'):
#      index,3,...
# or whether you are mapping channels by the text name displayed by
# Vixen for the channel:
#      name,Red Tree #12,...
#
# In either case, the next two fields give the controller name and channel
# as defined in the Lumos show configuration file.  For example, in the
# following mapping file, The first three Vixen channels map to channel
# number 1, 3, and 12 of controller 'fg1' respectively:
#       index,0,fg1,1
#       index,1,fg1,3
#       index,2,fg1,12
# while in this one, the Vixen channel for red, green and blue flood
# lights are mapped to X-10 channels in house code C on the controller 
# called 'xfloods':
#       name,red floodlights,xfloods,c5
#       name,green floodlights,xfloods,c6
#       name,blue floodlights,xfloods,c7
#
# Spaces should *not* be added around the commas or before or after the
# data on the line.
