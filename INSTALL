Lumos 0.3a2 Installation Notes

Installing Lumos is usually a straightforward task.  Before beginning, check
that your system includes the following software which Lumos requires:

   * Python 2.5 or later (Lumos has not yet been tested for Python 3.x.  A
     2.x version of Python is recommended.)

   * PySerial 2.4 or later

   * PyParallel 0.2 or later

   Copies of PySerial and PyParallel are available at lumos.sourceforge.net
   along with the Lumos distribution if you can't find them at their official
   distribution sites.

________________________________________________________________________________
(1) Unpack the Lumos distribution into a temporary working directory, and 
    change to that directory.  
	
	For a typical Linux/Unix system, this would look something like this:

	   $ tar xvzf Lumos-0.3a2.tar.gz
	   $ cd Lumos-0.3a2

________________________________________________________________________________
(2) If you wish to validate Lumos, you may run the unit tests which will
    check out Lumos's internal code to make sure it produces the expected
	results.  The simplest way to do this is:

	   $ cd Test
	   $ ./texttestrunner
	   $ cd ..

	(Alternatively, you could run ./testrunner, which brings up the PyUnit
	test GUI.  Click the [START] button to launch the test suite.)

________________________________________________________________________________
(3) To install Lumos onto your system, just run the setup.py script:

       $ python setup.py install

	You will need sufficient permissions to write the Lumos class library
	files into your Python site_packages directory and the user scripts
	into a public bin directory (usually /usr/bin by default).  You may
	choose to have setup.py install these files into another location
	(for example, if you want them installed in your own home directory).
	To see the list of options you can give to the setup script, run:

	   $ python setup.py install --help

	In particular, you probably want to use --home if installing Lumos
	locally in your home directory, or --prefix, --install-purelib,
	and/or --install-scripts if you are an administrator wishing to
	install into a non-standard directory.

________________________________________________________________________________
(4) Note that the documentation files under the "man" directory are not
    installed anywhere by default.  If you want the Lumos documents added
	to your "man" command, copy these into the appropriate manpage 
	directories on your system.  PDF copies of these documents are also
	available under the "man/pdf" directory.  You can copy these where
	you can refer to them as needed.
