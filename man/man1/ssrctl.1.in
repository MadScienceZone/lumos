.SH NAME
ssrctl \- Lumos solid-state relay controller adjustment tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ssrctl
.RB [ \-hfTv ]
.RB [ \-c
.IR file ]
.RI [ commands... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The
.B ssrctl
utility is used to manually adjust the outputs of the controllers in a Lumos
show.  Two modes are supported: batch and interactive.  
.LP
In batch mode, a list of one or more
.I commands
are given on the command line, and are executed in the order listed.
The commands available are:
.TP
.RI [ target ]\fB=\fP value [\fB/\fP interval ]
Set the 
.IR target 's
channel output(s) to the specified
.I value
(as a percentage from 0\-100).
If the optional
.I interval
value is given (separated from 
.I value
with a slash), the transition from the
current output level to the new
.I value
will be made gradually over 
.I interval
milliseconds.  
.B N.B.:
In order for this to work properly, 
.B ssrctl
needs to know what the current output level of
that controller is.  This means the output is
currently at zero (the starting assumption made
by
.BR ssrctl )
or you must have previously issued a level-setting
command for it in this invocation of
.BR ssrctl .
.TP
.RI [ target ]\fB:k\fP
Kill output to the 
.I target
channel(s).  This brings the output
level to zero, regardless of any minimum
\*(lqwarm\*(rq configuration.
.TP
.RI [ target ]\fB:p\fP
Print the current level for the
.I target
channel(s) to the standard output.
This is the level
.B ssrctl
assumes it to be.  There are a number
of circumstances where the hardware may
be in a different state and
.B ssrctl
has no way to know about that.
.TP
.RI [ target ]\fB:x\fP
Turn the output of the
.I target
channel(s) off.  If a channel has a minimum
\*(lqwarm\*(rq configuration setting, this
will be the new level used; otherwise it is
turned down to zero.
.LP
In these commands, the
.I target
is normally a single output channel of a single
controller unit (but see below), specified as:
.TP
.IB controller . channel
Specify the controller and channel name as listed
in the show configuration file.  The command will 
affect that one channel.
.TP
.IB controller .*
Target all channels of
.IR controller ,
affecting them all simultaneously.
.TP
.B *.*
Target all channels of all controllers.
.TP
.I channel
Target the specified
.I channel
of the same controller as used for the previous command.
.LP
If no
.I target
is specified before the command at all, then the same
target as was used for the previous command is used.
Thus, the command list
.RS
.B "ssr.13=10 =50/1000 =100"
.RE
takes channel 13 of the unit \*(lqssr\*(rq to 10%
immediately, then fades from there to 50% over the 
period of 1 second (1000 milliseconds), then sets it
to 100%.
.LP
If no
.IR command s
are given on the command line, 
.B ssrctl
goes into interactive mode, prompting the user to type commands
one per line on the standard input; terminate by typing an EOF
at the prompt (^D on Unix/Linux systems, ^Z on Windows/DOS systems).
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The following options may be given to
.BR ssrctl .
They may be specified using either short format, e.g.:
.LP
.RS
.na
.B "ssrctl \-f \-c show.conf ssr.*:k"
.ad
.RE
.LP
Or using the longer format, e.g.:
.LP
.RS
.na
.B "ssrtcl \-\-force \-\-config=show.conf ssr.*:k"
.ad
.RE
.LP
Or a combination of both.
.LP
The following options may be given to
.BR ssrctl :
.TP 10
.BI \-c " file"
.RB ( \-\-config=\fIfile\fP )
Get show configuration information from the specified
.IR file .
This is necessary for Lumos programs such as
.B ssrctl
to know what hardware is part of the show, and how to communicate with it.
Note that the
.I file
parameter may consist of multiple comma-delimited filenames if the show configuration
is stored in several files.
.TP
.B \-h
.RB ( \-\-help )
Print a basic help message and exit.
.TP
.B \-f
.RB ( \-\-force )
Force output of channel changing commands, even if
.B ssrctl believes the channel is already at the requested
level.
.TP
.B \-T
.RB ( \-\-test )
Run in \*(lqtest mode\*(rq.  This describes what would have
been sent to the hardware without actually sending output.
.TP
.B \-v
.RB ( \-\-verbose )
Print informational output which would ordinarily be suppressed.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Prints the version number of the program and exits.
