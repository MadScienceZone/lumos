Since this is a do-it-yourself project, the quality of the final product, and whether it 
functions as intended, is largely a result of your own efforts in building it.  As such, we
cannot offer to troubleshoot, repair, or replace a board we did not assemble for you.  Accordingly,
\marginpar{\centerline{\LLimg[height=.5in]{danger-sign}}}
these instructions, and all accompanying plans, schematics, software, hardware, and other
project materials are provided to you ``\mc{AS-IS}'' at no cost, as a courtesy between 
\acronym{DIY} hobbyists with \mc{NO WARRANTY} of any kind expressed or implied.  If you proceed
to build and/or use this unit, you do so \mc{ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK}.

If you purchased hardware materials from us (such as a PC board or programmed controller chip),
we will---at our sole discretion---replace, repair, or refund the cost of those materials if they were defective in manufacture
as shipped to you, up to 90~days from the date they were shipped to you,
but are not liable for damage caused by your handling or assembly of the unit.
Otherwise, we make no representation of suitability or fitness for any particular purpose and disclaim
all other warranty or liability of any kind to the full extent permitted by law.
