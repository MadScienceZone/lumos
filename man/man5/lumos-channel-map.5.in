.SH NAME
Lumos Channel Map File \- Assignment of Vixen Channels to Lumos Channels
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B #Comment
.LP
.IB idx , name , controller , channel
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This document describes the format of files used by Lumos to define
mappings between channels referenced by external sequence sources
(e.g., Vixen sequence files) and Lumos channels used by a particular
show.
.LP
The overall file format is standard CSV (comma-separated value).
This allows you to edit the file using a spreadsheet program
(e.g., OpenOffice Calc*, GNU Gnumeric*, or Microsoft Office Excel*) if that's 
preferred, so long as you save the file into CSV format.
.LP
Specifically:
.TP 
(1)
The file is organized into a sequential collection of records,
each describing a single \*(lqmapping\*(rq or \*(lqcomment\*(rq
(q.v.).  Each record is stored on a single line of the file
(terminated by a carriage-return and linefeed).
.TP 
(2)
Each record is further divided into \*(lqfields\*(rq, separated
from one another by commas 
.RB ( , ).
.TP 
(3)
If a data field itself contains one or more commas, it must be
enclosed in double quote characters 
.RB ( \(dq ).  
Surrounding other
data fields in quotes is permitted but not required.
.TP
(4)
Literal double-quote characters inside a quoted field are
specified by doubling them
.RB ( \(dq\(dq ),
for example:
.RS
.B "12,\(dqChannel \(dq\(dqX\(dq\(dq...\(dq,a,0"
.RE
.TP
(5)
A newline may appear inside a quoted field.  That field, including
the newline, continues on the next line of the file.  This is discouraged
and not guaranteed to be supported in future versions.
.TP
(6)
All data in the file should be printable ASCII characters.
.TP
(7)
Blank space around commas should
.I not
be included in the file unless you intend for the field
contents to include those spaces as part of the data
field.
.SS Comments
.LP
Any record whose first field begins with a 
.B #
character is assumed to be a comment, and the entire record
is ignored.  Be aware, however, that all the rules
for the CSV file format must still be adhered to.
.SS Mappings
.LP
A mapping record describes a single assignment of an external
(e.g., Vixen) output channel to a single Lumos channel, in this format:
.LP
.RS
.IB idx , name , controller , channel
.RE
.LP
The source (Vixen) channel is specified in the first two fields, which 
are:
.TP 13
.I idx
The index number of the channel.  The first channel appearing in the
sequence file is number 0, the next is 1, and so on.
.TP
.I name
The text name of the channel as displayed in the Vixen sequence editing grid.
.LP
If you generate this file via 
.BR vixen2lumos (1)
with the
.B \-\-genmap
option, both
.I idx
and
.I name
fields will be filled in.  However, it is permitted for one of these to 
be empty.  If only
.I idx
is given, whatever channel is in that position in the sequence file will 
be used.  If 
.I name
is given, the channel with that name is found.  If both are used, they must
both apply (i.e., the named channel must be at that index position in the file).
.LP
The same source channel may not be mapped more than one time, however multiple
source channels may be mapped to the same destination channel (merging
their events so any action taken on either of the original channels
affects the same Lumos channel).
.LP
The destination channel is specified by the third and fourth fields:
.TP 13
.I controller
The name of the controller supplying this channel, as defined in the Lumos
show configuration file.
.TP
.I channel
The channel name within the designated controller.
.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
A mapping from the first three Vixen channels (called
\*(lqA\*(rq, \*(lqB\*(rq, and \*(lqC\*(rq) to, respectively,
Lumos controller \*(lqfloods\*(rq channel 12 and \*(lqtrees\*(rq
channels 1 and 2, would look like this:
.LP
.RS
.nf
.na
# Lumos map file for my show
0,A,floods,12
1,B,trees,1
2,C,trees,2
.ad
.fi
.RE
.LP
If the index positions of these were not known, the names alone
could be used:
.LP
.RS
.nf
.na
# Lumos map file for my show
,A,floods,12
,B,trees,1
,C,trees,2
.ad
