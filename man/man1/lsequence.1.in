.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The
.B lsequence
program is an interactive sequence editor for Lumos sequence files.
It is a GUI application which displays sequence events on a scollable
grid with virtual channels in the vertical direction, and time increasing
to the right in the horizontal direction.
.LP
Note that
.B lsequence
presents a high-level view of the channels, not at all concerned with
actual hardware, device limitations, power constraints, etc.  To edit
a sequence, you are simply orchestrating what the show effects should
look like, so the focus is on when various things happen in the show.
Use other programs such as
.BR lpower (1)
and
.BR lcheck (1)
to evaluate the lower-level configuration of the show's hardware and
the run-time characteristics of the sequence.  The sequence itself may
be played on actual hardware using
.BR lplay (1).
.LP
The show configuration file, therefore, need only contain definitions
of the virtual channels in addition to the general title and description
fields for the show itself, to use
.B lsequence
(although it will need to be complete before using the other,
hardware-aware, parts of Lumos).
.LP
A full description of how to use 
.B lsequence
is found in the user manual for Lumos.  This manual page entry is
only a brief summary highlighting invocation and basic usage.
Please read the user manual for best results.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The following options may be given to
.BR lsequence .
They may be specified using either short format, e.g.:
.LP
.RS
.na
.B "lsequence \-v \-c show.conf \-s myshow.lseq"
.ad
.RE
.LP
Or using the longer format, e.g.:
.LP
.RS
.na
.B "lsequence \-\-verbose \-\-config=show.conf \-\-sequence=myshow.lseq"
.ad
.RE
.LP
Or a combination of both.
.LP
The following options may be given to
.BR lsequence :
.TP 10
.BI \-c " file"
.RB ( \-\-config=\fIfile\fP )
Get show configuration information from the specified
.IR file .
This is necessary for Lumos programs such as
.B lsequence
to know what channels will be controlled, and some basic information
about their nature (e.g., can they be dimmed, do they display in
different colors, etc.), but for
.BR lsequence 's
purposes, the configuration file does not need to contain hardware
formation such as power supplies, controller types, communications
networks, and so forth.  (That information will need to be supplied
before the show can be actually performed, however.)
.B Lsequence
only looks at the virtual channel definitions in this file, as well
as some other general Lumos information.
'\".TP
'\".BI \-D " file"
'\".RB ( \-\-debug=\fIfile\fP )
'\"Write debugging information to the specified
'\".IR file .
'\"This is probably only interesting to Lumos developers and maintainers.
.TP
.B \-h
.RB ( \-\-help )
Print a basic help message and exit.
.TP
.BI \-s " file"
Specifies the sequence file to be edited.  If this option is omitted,
a blank sequence editor will be shown, without an associated disk file.
An existing seuqence may then be loaded by selecting the \*(lqopen\*(rq
command within the program, if needed.
.TP
.B \-v
.RB ( \-\-verbose )
Print information about the operation of the program which is
not normally shown.
This may go to the standard output and/or a GUI window.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Prints the version number of the program and exits.

.SH VERSION
.LP
This document describes version @@VERSION@@ of
.BR lsequence .
.SH HISTORY
.LP
This program appeared in Lumos version 1.0.
Note that, as with the other Lumos programs, 
.B lsequence
will load older sequence and configuration file formats, but will
convert them to the latest version while working with them.  It will
only save the current file format.  Support for legacy formats
may be limited as time goes on, and may disappear in the future for
the oldest formats.
