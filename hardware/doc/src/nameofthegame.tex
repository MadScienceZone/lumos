\section{The Name of the Game}
The name ``Lumos'' is a combination of \emph{lumen}, the Latin word for ``light,''
and the initial letters of ``Orchestration System.''  Hence, ``Light Orchestration System''
which is the most common application for which the Lumos hardware and software are used---running
computerized lighting displays.
