\section{How to Use this Manual}
Please begin by reviewing the safety information in Chapter~\ref{ch:safety}.  

When you are ready to begin assembling your Lumos controller, gather the required tools and materials
as explained in Chapter~\ref{ch:materials}.  

Then read carefully the \emph{entire} set of instructions in the following chapters before
beginning any actual work.  Begin assembly \emph{only} if you understand all the steps you will need
to carry out.

Once your controller is complete and ready to use, refer to the separate manual,
\emph{Using the Lumos SSR Controllers} for full instructions on how to program
and use your controller.
