\chapter{Colophon}
This manual was composed and typeset by the author using \LaTeX\ with Memoir layout macros,
augmented by wrapfig, lettrine, bytefield, wallpaper, Ti\emph{k}Z,
and a host of miscellaneous behind-the-scenes working packages.

It was set 10/12\,pt using the \TeX\ Gyre Schola font family created by \acronym{GUST}, the
Polish \TeX\ User Group.  This typeface is based on URW Century Schoolbook L,
originally designed by Morris Fuller Benton in 1919, for the American Type Founders. 

Schematics were generated using the g\acronym{EDA} tool {\ttfamily gschem}. The \acronym{PCB} layout
illustrations were created by {\ttfamily pcb} on Linux.  All of the above are free and open-source
tools.

Published electronically in \acronym{PDF} format for ease of viewing on any platform.
