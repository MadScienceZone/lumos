.SH NAME
lumos-network \- Lumos network protocol device driver implementation notes
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The Lumos light circuit sequencing program was designed to be extended for
use with arbitrary hardware by \*(lqplugging in\*(rq device drivers 
for new types of hardware.  This document describes the general design
of Lumos' network driver system and how one would go about writing a 
new driver for a hardware interface for Lumos.
.LP
The Lumos program is implemented in Python, and the network drivers are simply
Python modules which each define an object class describing a particular type
of network port and the protocol used by it.  
.SS "Theory of Operation"
.LP
Each network driver class describes a certain kind of communications interface.
The main application software will create an instance of each network class
for each network described in the 
show configuration
file, and will then call the
.B add_unit()
method in each, to set up the active controller units used in the show which
are attached to that network interface.
.LP
During the operation of the show, various device drivers will call the
.B send()
method in their associated network controllers to transmit bytes out to the
various controllers attached to the network.
.LP
No device is expected to ever send data back to Lumos; these drivers are 
write-only.
.SS "Definition of the Network Class"
.LP
Each network driver is a separate module (and therefore stored in its own 
file).  To start a new network driver, create a file with an appropriate name
such as 
.RB \*(lq CarrierPigeonNetwork.py \*(rq.
.LP
All network driver classes are subclasses of 
.BR Network ,
which is an abstract base class describing the essential attributes and 
behaviors of all network types.  If you haven't already done so, look
over the documentation for that module (the simplest way is to type the
command
.RB \*(lq "pydoc Lumos.Network" \*(rq
from inside the Lumos source directory (or from anywhere once Lumos is installed
on your system).
.LP
Note also that where there are some general groupings of similar kinds of 
networks, intermediate classes should be created.  Thus, while 
.B SerialNetwork
is a direct subclass of 
.BR Network ,
A future network driver which is similar but differs in only some
minor way would be a subclass of
.B SerialNetwork
and merely extend that class rather than duplicating most of the
same functionality independently.
.SS "Extending the Network Class"
.LP
You need to extend the base 
.B Network
class by adding the following methods as appropriate for your device.
In each case, check with the 
.B Network
object class definition (using 
.B pydoc
for example) and 
.I "do not deviate from the call signatures"
indicated there (as far as number or position of arguments, which are optional, etc.)
.LP
You MUST define device-specific versions of these methods (unless you
are inheriting from an intermediate class which does define them sufficiently):
.TP
.BI send( cmd )
Transmit the command codes in the string value
.I cmd
to the network.
.TP
.BI __init__( id ", " \fR[\fPdescription\fR]\fP ", \fR...\fP)"
The class constructor should open the communications port, create a thread
or subprocess to handle communications protocols which need to continue 
transmitting slow bitrates while Lumos continues operating, etc.  It will be passed additional keyword arguments as found in the
show configuration
file.
.TP
.B close()
This closes the communication port gracefully.
.LP
You MAY, but possibly won't need to, extend the following methods:
.TP
.BI add_unit( id ", " unit )
This method will be called by the Lumos application based on the
show configuration data, to assign active controllers to your network.
The default implementation of 
.B add_unit()
is a simple routine to add the device driver object reference passed
as 
.I unit
to the internal list of units plugged in to this network.
That's usually sufficient.
.LP
Since the drivers which ship with Lumos are available as source files,
it would be instructive to examine them as a pattern to follow when creating
new drivers.
.SS "Registering Your Network Driver"
.LP
The 
.RB \*(lq Networks \*(rq
module provides a mapping from the network device names presented to the
user (e.g., those usable in the
show configuration
file's description of controller types), and which actual network driver module
to use to actually perform the communications.
.LP
To add your new driver to the list, simply edit 
.B Networks.py
and add two lines: an import statement to import the driver class,
and an entry in the
.B supported_network_types
dictionary.  
For example, if we called our controllers \*(lqpigeon\*(rq in all the
user-visible areas of Lumos, the first few lines of the
.B Networks.py
file might look like this:
.RS
.na
.nf
\&.
\&.
\&.
.B "from CarrierPigeonNetwork import CarrierPigeonNetwork"
.B "supported_network_types = {"
.B "\ \ \ 'serial':  SerialNetwork,"
.B "\ \ \ 'cm17a':   FirecrackerSerialNetwork,"
.B "\ \ \ 'pigeon':  CarrierPigeonNetwork,"
.B }
